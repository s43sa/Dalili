# Dalili
Recommendation system for finding the best ideas for graduation project.

Students sometimes face a problem in choosing a suitable idea for their graduation project. To help them overcome this problem, a website called Dalili has been created.
The proposed website has been developed with the aim to recommend project ideas that  are compatible with the abilities and preferences of the student. This helps narrow the search space of the ideas, then the student can improve and develop the features of the  available ideas or inspired to suggest a total new idea based on the available ones. To accomplish the project, I have collected dataset of many project ideas in different  computation fields from different universities. The user of the website can enter search words or sentences to find the most similar ideas from the dataset. I used the Content based recommendation system, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and The Word2Vec to recommend the most similar idea. The similarity was measured using Cosine distance equation.
