Artificial Intelligence,"Everyone has a unique voice, because of the different structure of their articulatory organs. Some people have similar voices due to biological similarity or someone is mimicking them. This similarity raises a security concern. Several studies tried to distinguish between similar voices of people using speaker recognition techniques. Speaker recognition not only models an individual’s voice but also their speaking habits. This project proposes  the use of automatic speaker recognition techniques in order to explore the similarity between siblings. This includes comparing the performance of several models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and i-vector.

Computer Vision and Graphics,"There is a lack of applications in Arabic that serve specific groups such as children with autism. Autism includes impairments in social interaction and developmental language and communication skills combined with rigid and repetitive behaviors. The studies indicate that the children are positively influenced by applications by showing better verbal interaction and the physical activity are increased at activities when using applications. This project aims to facilitate some of the difficulties faced by children with ASD by using technology. But what are the most important difficulties that need technology support and which technology is most effective with children with ASD? Through our searches, visits and interviews with ASD centers we came to that most children with ASD face challenges in most self-care skills, such as teeth brushing, eating, bathing, and others. Also, one of the suggestions from the therapists is to use AR technology and how it facilitates children's learning as they are attracted to the notable things like 3D objects and interact with them in a positive way. The results of this project will be an application which support children with ASD in learning number of self-care skills and prepare them to realize these skills and their tools faster and in loveable approach through the use of AR technology in Arabic language.","C_sharp,Cpp,Python,Java",UMM ALQura,https://drive.uqu.edu.sa/up/forms/cis/19197/343172/cwP8XuGFtr_1588791353_j8v548Z476.pdf ,0

However, it experiences a lack of technical support as therapeutic exercises requires the direct supervision of a therapist. Among many technical areas, AR can overlay the real world in a digital world, helping the patients by providing the possibility of performing rehabilitation exercises by themselves offline the direct supervision of a therapist. The project aims to help patients outside the clinic, as most patients have difficulty understanding the prescribed exercises correctly on their own. Also, the worst is when injuries may occur due to incorrect performance of exercises. To perform rehabilitation exercises accurately, patients need immediate feedback. The project uses the so-called Human Pose Skeleton, which does the therapeutic exercises and monitors the movement of the patient in real-time. So that it becomes easier for the patient to see the movements of prescribed exercise and their body at the same time thus the patient is like a shadow of that Human Pose Skeleton trying to follow its movement and match them to ensure the correct performance of these unsupervised exercises. Nowadays, the market demands a mobile phone application that meets the needs of patients while performing therapeutic exercises in easy-to-use means and accessible to everyone who needs it as much as possible.

Information Security,"Present-day health care systems are information-dense and progressively relying on computer- based information systems. Unfortunately, many of these information system’s use is predominantly restricted to the collection and retrieval of patient records. The failure to digitally communicate and transfer medical record information to other health information systems is undoubtedly a major barrier to efficient patient care and other clinical decision making, and the interoperability between heterogeneous systems still remains a challenge even with decades of investment. The implementation of a safe bi-directional document exchange system is a part of enhancing interoperability by providing a safe messenger system to support some of the core interaction medical documents. Lack of interoperability can also jeopardize patient safety and led to technology-related medical accidents. Hence, the project also focuses on the safety aspect of the system and provides an in-depth hazard analysis along with the implementation of a safety monitoring system to notify users about unexpected system failures.","HTML,JavaScript,CSS",University of Victoria,http://hdl.handle.net/1828/12884,0
